        It's been one week exactly since I have started The Odin Project.
        I managed to finish the HTML and CSS portion of the foundation module in one week.
        Learning the basics of HTML and CSS was relatively simple, but I feel like I struggled with the cascade and how to efficient nest.
        I definitely want to come back to some basic concepts but for now I an pushing forward and starting javascript.

        I started the javascript foundations module yesterday. It's making a lot of sense but it's obvious this is something that will take time to master.
        Being able to make things function and DO stuff is very exciting though. Javascript is definitely a lot more interesting to me then CSS.
