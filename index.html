        It's been one week exactly since I have started The Odin Project.
        I managed to finish the HTML and CSS portion of the foundation module in one week.
        Learning the basics of HTML and CSS was relatively simple, but I feel like I struggled with the cascade and how to efficient nest.
        I definitely want to come back to some basic concepts but for now I an pushing forward and starting javascript.

        I started the javascript foundations module yesterday. It's making a lot of sense but it's obvious this is something that will take time to master.
        Being able to make things function and DO stuff is very exciting though. Javascript is definitely a lot more interesting to me then CSS.

        Today, I'm learning conditionals and it makes a lot of sense, but I'm having a difficult time with getting the syntax itself down.

        Another day another lesson. Yesterday, was tough. I was stuck on conditionals for longer than I would have liked. I understood the logic and concept of it all.
        The problem was when I went to do the exercise, I had difficulty applying those concepts. After rereading the article about five times, I decided to take an early lunch.
        I'm glad I did because it clicked when I came back from the break. I watched a video on the concepts and found another source for exercises. I was able to do those exercises pretty easily.
        This is a reminder to myself to not get so caught up when I'm stuck. Take a break and find different sources to learn the concept from.
