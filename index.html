        It's been one week exactly since I have started The Odin Project.
        I managed to finish the HTML and CSS portion of the foundation module in one week.
        HTML and CSS was relatively simple, but I feel like I struggle with the cascade and how to efficient nest.
        I definitely want to come back to some basic concepts but for now I an pushing forward and starting javascript.
